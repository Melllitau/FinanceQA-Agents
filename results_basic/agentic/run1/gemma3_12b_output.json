Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2024 were approximately 908,000 RSUs vested but\nnot yet delivered.\nSummary of Stock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits:\n2024 2023 2022\nStock-based compensation expense $ 818 $ 774 $ 724\nLess recognized income tax benefit 173 163 154\nStock-based compensation expense, net $ 645 $ 611 $ 570Note 5—Leases\nThe tables below present information regarding the Company's lease assets and liabilities.\n2024 2023\nAssets\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 2,617 $ 2,713\n(1)\nFinance lease assets 1,433 1,325\nTotal lease assets $ 4,050 $ 4,038\nLiabilities\nCurrent\nLong-term\n(2)\nOperating lease liabilities $ 179 $ 220\n(2)\nFinance lease liabilities 147 129\nOperating lease liabilities 2,375 2,426\n(3)\nFinance lease liabilities 1,351 1,303\nTotal lease liabilities $ 4,052 $ 4,078\n_______________\n(1) (2) (3) Included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases 19 20\nFinance leases 23 24\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases 2.67 % 2.47 %\nFinance leases 4.59 % 4.47 %\n52\nTable of Contents\n2024 2023 2022\nOperating lease costs (1)\n$ 284 $ 309 $ 297\nFinance lease costs:\nAmortization of lease assets (1)\n97 169 128\nInterest on lease liabilities (2)\n58 54 Variable lease costs (1)\n163 160 157\nTotal lease costs $ 602 $ 692 $ 627\nThe components of lease expense, excluding short-term lease costs and sublease income (which were immaterial), were as follows:\n45\n_______________\n(1) (2) Included in selling, general and administrative expenses and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nIncluded in interest expense and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows — operating leases $ 274 $ 287 $ 277\nOperating cash flows — finance leases 58 54 45\nFinancing cash flows — finance leases 136 291 176\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 125 202 Finance lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 200 100 231\n794\nAs of September 1, 2024, future minimum payments during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n_______________\n(1) (2) Operating lease payments have not been reduced by expected future sublease income of $98.\nExcludes $1,080 of lease payments for leases that have been signed but not commenced.\nNote 6—Equity\nDividends\n(1)\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\n2025 $ 242 $ 204\n2026 247 128\n2027 226 120\n2028 209 122\n2029 183 109\nThereafter 2,205 1,664\nTotal (2)\n3,312 2,347\nLess amount representing interest 758 849\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,554 $ 1,498Note 4—Debt\nShort-Term Borrowings\nThe Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1.

The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1.

The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2024 were approximately 908,000 RSUs vested but\nnot yet delivered.\nSummary of Stock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits:\n2024 2023 2022\nStock-based compensation expense $ 818 $ 774 $ 724\nLess recognized income tax benefit 173 163 154\nStock-based compensation expense, net $ 645 $ 611 $ 570Note 5—Leases\nThe tables below present information regarding the Company's lease assets and liabilities.\n2024 2023\nAssets\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 2,617 $ 2,713\n(1)\nFinance lease assets 1,433 1,325\nTotal lease assets $ 4,050 $ 4,038\nLiabilities\nCurrent\nLong-term\n(2)\nOperating lease liabilities $ 179 $ 220\n(2)\nFinance lease liabilities 147 129\nOperating lease liabilities 2,375 2,426\n(3)\nFinance lease liabilities 1,351 1,303\nTotal lease liabilities $ 4,052 $ 4,078\n_______________\n(1) (2) (3) Included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases 19 20\nFinance leases 23 24\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases 2.67 % 2.47 %\nFinance leases 4.59 % 4.47 %\n52\nTable of Contents\n2024 2023 2022\nOperating lease costs (1)\n$ 284 $ 309 $ 297\nFinance lease costs:\nAmortization of lease assets (1)\n97 169 128\nInterest on lease liabilities (2)\n58 54 Variable lease costs (1)\n163 160 157\nTotal lease costs $ 602 $ 692 $ 627\nThe components of lease expense, excluding short-term lease costs and sublease income (which were immaterial), were as follows:\n45\n_______________\n(1) (2) Included in selling, general and administrative expenses and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nIncluded in interest expense and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows — operating leases $ 274 $ 287 $ 277\nOperating cash flows — finance leases 58 54 45\nFinancing cash flows — finance leases 136 291 176\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 125 202 Finance lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 200 100 231\n794\nAs of September 1, 2024, future minimum payments during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n_______________\n(1) (2) Operating lease payments have not been reduced by expected future sublease income of $98.\nExcludes $1,080 of lease payments for leases that have been signed but not commenced.\nNote 6—Equity\nDividends\n(1)\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\n2025 $ 242 $ 204\n2026 247 128\n2027 226 120\n2028 209 122\n2029 183 109\nThereafter 2,205 1,664\nTotal (2)\n3,312 2,347\nLess amount representing interest 758 849\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,554 $ 1,498Note 4—Debt\nShort-Term Borrowings\nThe Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738.

Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2024 were approximately 908,000 RSUs vested but\nnot yet delivered.\nSummary of Stock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits:\n2024 2023 2022\nStock-based compensation expense $ 818 $ 774 $ 724\nLess recognized income tax benefit 173 163 154\nStock-based compensation expense, net $ 645 $ 611 $ 570Note 5—Leases\nThe tables below present information regarding the Company's lease assets and liabilities.\n2024 2023\nAssets\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 2,617 $ 2,713\n(1)\nFinance lease assets 1,433 1,325\nTotal lease assets $ 4,050 $ 4,038\nLiabilities\nCurrent\nLong-term\n(2)\nOperating lease liabilities $ 179 $ 220\n(2)\nFinance lease liabilities 147 129\nOperating lease liabilities 2,375 2,426\n(3)\nFinance lease liabilities 1,351 1,303\nTotal lease liabilities $ 4,052 $ 4,078\n_______________\n(1) (2) (3) Included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases 19 20\nFinance leases 23 24\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases 2.67 % 2.47 %\nFinance leases 4.59 % 4.47 %\n52\nTable of Contents\n2024 2023 2022\nOperating lease costs (1)\n$ 284 $ 309 $ 297\nFinance lease costs:\nAmortization of lease assets (1)\n97 169 128\nInterest on lease liabilities (2)\n58 54 Variable lease costs (1)\n163 160 157\nTotal lease costs $ 602 $ 692 $ 627\nThe components of lease expense, excluding short-term lease costs and sublease income (which were immaterial), were as follows:\n45\n_______________\n(1) (2) Included in selling, general and administrative expenses and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nIncluded in interest expense and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows — operating leases $ 274 $ 287 $ 277\nOperating cash flows — finance leases 58 54 45\nFinancing cash flows — finance leases 136 291 176\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 125 202 Finance lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 200 100 231\n794\nAs of September 1, 2024, future minimum payments during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n_______________\n(1) (2) Operating lease payments have not been reduced by expected future sublease income of $98.\nExcludes $1,080 of lease payments for leases that have been signed but not commenced.\nNote 6—Equity\nDividends\n(1)\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\n2025 $ 242 $ 204\n2026 247 128\n2027 226 120\n2028 209 122\n2029 183 109\nThereafter 2,205 1,664\nTotal (2)\n3,312 2,347\nLess amount representing interest 758 849\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,554 $ 1,498Note 4—Debt\nShort-Term Borrowings\nThe Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations.

The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on the dividend record date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the\nex-dividend date. The outstanding RSUs increased by approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation\nexpense, as the fair value of the awards did not change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares\nissuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted, which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024.

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1.

The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2024 were approximately 908,000 RSUs vested but\nnot yet delivered.\nSummary of Stock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits:\n2024 2023 2022\nStock-based compensation expense $ 818 $ 774 $ 724\nLess recognized income tax benefit 173 163 154\nStock-based compensation expense, net $ 645 $ 611 $ 570Note 5—Leases\nThe tables below present information regarding the Company's lease assets and liabilities.\n2024 2023\nAssets\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 2,617 $ 2,713\n(1)\nFinance lease assets 1,433 1,325\nTotal lease assets $ 4,050 $ 4,038\nLiabilities\nCurrent\nLong-term\n(2)\nOperating lease liabilities $ 179 $ 220\n(2)\nFinance lease liabilities 147 129\nOperating lease liabilities 2,375 2,426\n(3)\nFinance lease liabilities 1,351 1,303\nTotal lease liabilities $ 4,052 $ 4,078\n_______________\n(1) (2) (3) Included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases 19 20\nFinance leases 23 24\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases 2.67 % 2.47 %\nFinance leases 4.59 % 4.47 %\n52\nTable of Contents\n2024 2023 2022\nOperating lease costs (1)\n$ 284 $ 309 $ 297\nFinance lease costs:\nAmortization of lease assets (1)\n97 169 128\nInterest on lease liabilities (2)\n58 54 Variable lease costs (1)\n163 160 157\nTotal lease costs $ 602 $ 692 $ 627\nThe components of lease expense, excluding short-term lease costs and sublease income (which were immaterial), were as follows:\n45\n_______________\n(1) (2) Included in selling, general and administrative expenses and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nIncluded in interest expense and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows — operating leases $ 274 $ 287 $ 277\nOperating cash flows — finance leases 58 54 45\nFinancing cash flows — finance leases 136 291 176\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 125 202 Finance lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 200 100 231\n794\nAs of September 1, 2024, future minimum payments during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n_______________\n(1) (2) Operating lease payments have not been reduced by expected future sublease income of $98.\nExcludes $1,080 of lease payments for leases that have been signed but not commenced.\nNote 6—Equity\nDividends\n(1)\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\n2025 $ 242 $ 204\n2026 247 128\n2027 226 120\n2028 209 122\n2029 183 109\nThereafter 2,205 1,664\nTotal (2)\n3,312 2,347\nLess amount representing interest 758 849\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,554 $ 1,498Note 4—Debt\nShort-Term Borrowings\nThe Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites.

Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1.

The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2024 were approximately 908,000 RSUs vested but\nnot yet delivered.\nSummary of Stock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits:\n2024 2023 2022\nStock-based compensation expense $ 818 $ 774 $ 724\nLess recognized income tax benefit 173 163 154\nStock-based compensation expense, net $ 645 $ 611 $ 570Note 5—Leases\nThe tables below present information regarding the Company's lease assets and liabilities.\n2024 2023\nAssets\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 2,617 $ 2,713\n(1)\nFinance lease assets 1,433 1,325\nTotal lease assets $ 4,050 $ 4,038\nLiabilities\nCurrent\nLong-term\n(2)\nOperating lease liabilities $ 179 $ 220\n(2)\nFinance lease liabilities 147 129\nOperating lease liabilities 2,375 2,426\n(3)\nFinance lease liabilities 1,351 1,303\nTotal lease liabilities $ 4,052 $ 4,078\n_______________\n(1) (2) (3) Included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases 19 20\nFinance leases 23 24\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases 2.67 % 2.47 %\nFinance leases 4.59 % 4.47 %\n52\nTable of Contents\n2024 2023 2022\nOperating lease costs (1)\n$ 284 $ 309 $ 297\nFinance lease costs:\nAmortization of lease assets (1)\n97 169 128\nInterest on lease liabilities (2)\n58 54 Variable lease costs (1)\n163 160 157\nTotal lease costs $ 602 $ 692 $ 627\nThe components of lease expense, excluding short-term lease costs and sublease income (which were immaterial), were as follows:\n45\n_______________\n(1) (2) Included in selling, general and administrative expenses and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nIncluded in interest expense and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows — operating leases $ 274 $ 287 $ 277\nOperating cash flows — finance leases 58 54 45\nFinancing cash flows — finance leases 136 291 176\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 125 202 Finance lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 200 100 231\n794\nAs of September 1, 2024, future minimum payments during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n_______________\n(1) (2) Operating lease payments have not been reduced by expected future sublease income of $98.\nExcludes $1,080 of lease payments for leases that have been signed but not commenced.\nNote 6—Equity\nDividends\n(1)\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\n2025 $ 242 $ 204\n2026 247 128\n2027 226 120\n2028 209 122\n2029 183 109\nThereafter 2,205 1,664\nTotal (2)\n3,312 2,347\nLess amount representing interest 758 849\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,554 $ 1,498Note 4—Debt\nShort-Term Borrowings\nThe Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites.

Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1.

The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites.

Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2024 were approximately 908,000 RSUs vested but\nnot yet delivered.\nSummary of Stock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits:\n2024 2023 2022\nStock-based compensation expense $ 818 $ 774 $ 724\nLess recognized income tax benefit 173 163 154\nStock-based compensation expense, net $ 645 $ 611 $ 570Note 5—Leases\nThe tables below present information regarding the Company's lease assets and liabilities.\n2024 2023\nAssets\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 2,617 $ 2,713\n(1)\nFinance lease assets 1,433 1,325\nTotal lease assets $ 4,050 $ 4,038\nLiabilities\nCurrent\nLong-term\n(2)\nOperating lease liabilities $ 179 $ 220\n(2)\nFinance lease liabilities 147 129\nOperating lease liabilities 2,375 2,426\n(3)\nFinance lease liabilities 1,351 1,303\nTotal lease liabilities $ 4,052 $ 4,078\n_______________\n(1) (2) (3) Included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases 19 20\nFinance leases 23 24\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases 2.67 % 2.47 %\nFinance leases 4.59 % 4.47 %\n52\nTable of Contents\n2024 2023 2022\nOperating lease costs (1)\n$ 284 $ 309 $ 297\nFinance lease costs:\nAmortization of lease assets (1)\n97 169 128\nInterest on lease liabilities (2)\n58 54 Variable lease costs (1)\n163 160 157\nTotal lease costs $ 602 $ 692 $ 627\nThe components of lease expense, excluding short-term lease costs and sublease income (which were immaterial), were as follows:\n45\n_______________\n(1) (2) Included in selling, general and administrative expenses and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nIncluded in interest expense and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows — operating leases $ 274 $ 287 $ 277\nOperating cash flows — finance leases 58 54 45\nFinancing cash flows — finance leases 136 291 176\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 125 202 Finance lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 200 100 231\n794\nAs of September 1, 2024, future minimum payments during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n_______________\n(1) (2) Operating lease payments have not been reduced by expected future sublease income of $98.\nExcludes $1,080 of lease payments for leases that have been signed but not commenced.\nNote 6—Equity\nDividends\n(1)\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\n2025 $ 242 $ 204\n2026 247 128\n2027 226 120\n2028 209 122\n2029 183 109\nThereafter 2,205 1,664\nTotal (2)\n3,312 2,347\nLess amount representing interest 758 849\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,554 $ 1,498Note 4—Debt\nShort-Term Borrowings\nThe Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%.

Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2024 were approximately 908,000 RSUs vested but\nnot yet delivered.\nSummary of Stock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits:\n2024 2023 2022\nStock-based compensation expense $ 818 $ 774 $ 724\nLess recognized income tax benefit 173 163 154\nStock-based compensation expense, net $ 645 $ 611 $ 570Note 5—Leases\nThe tables below present information regarding the Company's lease assets and liabilities.\n2024 2023\nAssets\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 2,617 $ 2,713\n(1)\nFinance lease assets 1,433 1,325\nTotal lease assets $ 4,050 $ 4,038\nLiabilities\nCurrent\nLong-term\n(2)\nOperating lease liabilities $ 179 $ 220\n(2)\nFinance lease liabilities 147 129\nOperating lease liabilities 2,375 2,426\n(3)\nFinance lease liabilities 1,351 1,303\nTotal lease liabilities $ 4,052 $ 4,078\n_______________\n(1) (2) (3) Included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases 19 20\nFinance leases 23 24\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases 2.67 % 2.47 %\nFinance leases 4.59 % 4.47 %\n52\nTable of Contents\n2024 2023 2022\nOperating lease costs (1)\n$ 284 $ 309 $ 297\nFinance lease costs:\nAmortization of lease assets (1)\n97 169 128\nInterest on lease liabilities (2)\n58 54 Variable lease costs (1)\n163 160 157\nTotal lease costs $ 602 $ 692 $ 627\nThe components of lease expense, excluding short-term lease costs and sublease income (which were immaterial), were as follows:\n45\n_______________\n(1) (2) Included in selling, general and administrative expenses and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nIncluded in interest expense and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows — operating leases $ 274 $ 287 $ 277\nOperating cash flows — finance leases 58 54 45\nFinancing cash flows — finance leases 136 291 176\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 125 202 Finance lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 200 100 231\n794\nAs of September 1, 2024, future minimum payments during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n_______________\n(1) (2) Operating lease payments have not been reduced by expected future sublease income of $98.\nExcludes $1,080 of lease payments for leases that have been signed but not commenced.\nNote 6—Equity\nDividends\n(1)\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\n2025 $ 242 $ 204\n2026 247 128\n2027 226 120\n2028 209 122\n2029 183 109\nThereafter 2,205 1,664\nTotal (2)\n3,312 2,347\nLess amount representing interest 758 849\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,554 $ 1,498Note 4—Debt\nShort-Term Borrowings\nThe Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%.

Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2024 were approximately 908,000 RSUs vested but\nnot yet delivered.\nSummary of Stock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits:\n2024 2023 2022\nStock-based compensation expense $ 818 $ 774 $ 724\nLess recognized income tax benefit 173 163 154\nStock-based compensation expense, net $ 645 $ 611 $ 570Note 5—Leases\nThe tables below present information regarding the Company's lease assets and liabilities.\n2024 2023\nAssets\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 2,617 $ 2,713\n(1)\nFinance lease assets 1,433 1,325\nTotal lease assets $ 4,050 $ 4,038\nLiabilities\nCurrent\nLong-term\n(2)\nOperating lease liabilities $ 179 $ 220\n(2)\nFinance lease liabilities 147 129\nOperating lease liabilities 2,375 2,426\n(3)\nFinance lease liabilities 1,351 1,303\nTotal lease liabilities $ 4,052 $ 4,078\n_______________\n(1) (2) (3) Included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases 19 20\nFinance leases 23 24\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases 2.67 % 2.47 %\nFinance leases 4.59 % 4.47 %\n52\nTable of Contents\n2024 2023 2022\nOperating lease costs (1)\n$ 284 $ 309 $ 297\nFinance lease costs:\nAmortization of lease assets (1)\n97 169 128\nInterest on lease liabilities (2)\n58 54 Variable lease costs (1)\n163 160 157\nTotal lease costs $ 602 $ 692 $ 627\nThe components of lease expense, excluding short-term lease costs and sublease income (which were immaterial), were as follows:\n45\n_______________\n(1) (2) Included in selling, general and administrative expenses and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nIncluded in interest expense and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows — operating leases $ 274 $ 287 $ 277\nOperating cash flows — finance leases 58 54 45\nFinancing cash flows — finance leases 136 291 176\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 125 202 Finance lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 200 100 231\n794\nAs of September 1, 2024, future minimum payments during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n_______________\n(1) (2) Operating lease payments have not been reduced by expected future sublease income of $98.\nExcludes $1,080 of lease payments for leases that have been signed but not commenced.\nNote 6—Equity\nDividends\n(1)\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\n2025 $ 242 $ 204\n2026 247 128\n2027 226 120\n2028 209 122\n2029 183 109\nThereafter 2,205 1,664\nTotal (2)\n3,312 2,347\nLess amount representing interest 758 849\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,554 $ 1,498Note 4—Debt\nShort-Term Borrowings\nThe Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1.

The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites.

Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon.

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2024 were approximately 908,000 RSUs vested but\nnot yet delivered.\nSummary of Stock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits:\n2024 2023 2022\nStock-based compensation expense $ 818 $ 774 $ 724\nLess recognized income tax benefit 173 163 154\nStock-based compensation expense, net $ 645 $ 611 $ 570Note 5—Leases\nThe tables below present information regarding the Company's lease assets and liabilities.\n2024 2023\nAssets\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 2,617 $ 2,713\n(1)\nFinance lease assets 1,433 1,325\nTotal lease assets $ 4,050 $ 4,038\nLiabilities\nCurrent\nLong-term\n(2)\nOperating lease liabilities $ 179 $ 220\n(2)\nFinance lease liabilities 147 129\nOperating lease liabilities 2,375 2,426\n(3)\nFinance lease liabilities 1,351 1,303\nTotal lease liabilities $ 4,052 $ 4,078\n_______________\n(1) (2) (3) Included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases 19 20\nFinance leases 23 24\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases 2.67 % 2.47 %\nFinance leases 4.59 % 4.47 %\n52\nTable of Contents\n2024 2023 2022\nOperating lease costs (1)\n$ 284 $ 309 $ 297\nFinance lease costs:\nAmortization of lease assets (1)\n97 169 128\nInterest on lease liabilities (2)\n58 54 Variable lease costs (1)\n163 160 157\nTotal lease costs $ 602 $ 692 $ 627\nThe components of lease expense, excluding short-term lease costs and sublease income (which were immaterial), were as follows:\n45\n_______________\n(1) (2) Included in selling, general and administrative expenses and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nIncluded in interest expense and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows — operating leases $ 274 $ 287 $ 277\nOperating cash flows — finance leases 58 54 45\nFinancing cash flows — finance leases 136 291 176\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 125 202 Finance lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 200 100 231\n794\nAs of September 1, 2024, future minimum payments during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n_______________\n(1) (2) Operating lease payments have not been reduced by expected future sublease income of $98.\nExcludes $1,080 of lease payments for leases that have been signed but not commenced.\nNote 6—Equity\nDividends\n(1)\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\n2025 $ 242 $ 204\n2026 247 128\n2027 226 120\n2028 209 122\n2029 183 109\nThereafter 2,205 1,664\nTotal (2)\n3,312 2,347\nLess amount representing interest 758 849\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,554 $ 1,498Note 4—Debt\nShort-Term Borrowings\nThe Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1.

The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2024 were approximately 908,000 RSUs vested but\nnot yet delivered.\nSummary of Stock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits:\n2024 2023 2022\nStock-based compensation expense $ 818 $ 774 $ 724\nLess recognized income tax benefit 173 163 154\nStock-based compensation expense, net $ 645 $ 611 $ 570Note 5—Leases\nThe tables below present information regarding the Company's lease assets and liabilities.\n2024 2023\nAssets\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 2,617 $ 2,713\n(1)\nFinance lease assets 1,433 1,325\nTotal lease assets $ 4,050 $ 4,038\nLiabilities\nCurrent\nLong-term\n(2)\nOperating lease liabilities $ 179 $ 220\n(2)\nFinance lease liabilities 147 129\nOperating lease liabilities 2,375 2,426\n(3)\nFinance lease liabilities 1,351 1,303\nTotal lease liabilities $ 4,052 $ 4,078\n_______________\n(1) (2) (3) Included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases 19 20\nFinance leases 23 24\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases 2.67 % 2.47 %\nFinance leases 4.59 % 4.47 %\n52\nTable of Contents\n2024 2023 2022\nOperating lease costs (1)\n$ 284 $ 309 $ 297\nFinance lease costs:\nAmortization of lease assets (1)\n97 169 128\nInterest on lease liabilities (2)\n58 54 Variable lease costs (1)\n163 160 157\nTotal lease costs $ 602 $ 692 $ 627\nThe components of lease expense, excluding short-term lease costs and sublease income (which were immaterial), were as follows:\n45\n_______________\n(1) (2) Included in selling, general and administrative expenses and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nIncluded in interest expense and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows — operating leases $ 274 $ 287 $ 277\nOperating cash flows — finance leases 58 54 45\nFinancing cash flows — finance leases 136 291 176\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 125 202 Finance lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 200 100 231\n794\nAs of September 1, 2024, future minimum payments during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n_______________\n(1) (2) Operating lease payments have not been reduced by expected future sublease income of $98.\nExcludes $1,080 of lease payments for leases that have been signed but not commenced.\nNote 6—Equity\nDividends\n(1)\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\n2025 $ 242 $ 204\n2026 247 128\n2027 226 120\n2028 209 122\n2029 183 109\nThereafter 2,205 1,664\nTotal (2)\n3,312 2,347\nLess amount representing interest 758 849\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,554 $ 1,498Note 4—Debt\nShort-Term Borrowings\nThe Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites.

Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2024 were approximately 908,000 RSUs vested but\nnot yet delivered.\nSummary of Stock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense and the related tax benefits:\n2024 2023 2022\nStock-based compensation expense $ 818 $ 774 $ 724\nLess recognized income tax benefit 173 163 154\nStock-based compensation expense, net $ 645 $ 611 $ 570Note 5—Leases\nThe tables below present information regarding the Company's lease assets and liabilities.\n2024 2023\nAssets\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 2,617 $ 2,713\n(1)\nFinance lease assets 1,433 1,325\nTotal lease assets $ 4,050 $ 4,038\nLiabilities\nCurrent\nLong-term\n(2)\nOperating lease liabilities $ 179 $ 220\n(2)\nFinance lease liabilities 147 129\nOperating lease liabilities 2,375 2,426\n(3)\nFinance lease liabilities 1,351 1,303\nTotal lease liabilities $ 4,052 $ 4,078\n_______________\n(1) (2) (3) Included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases 19 20\nFinance leases 23 24\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases 2.67 % 2.47 %\nFinance leases 4.59 % 4.47 %\n52\nTable of Contents\n2024 2023 2022\nOperating lease costs (1)\n$ 284 $ 309 $ 297\nFinance lease costs:\nAmortization of lease assets (1)\n97 169 128\nInterest on lease liabilities (2)\n58 54 Variable lease costs (1)\n163 160 157\nTotal lease costs $ 602 $ 692 $ 627\nThe components of lease expense, excluding short-term lease costs and sublease income (which were immaterial), were as follows:\n45\n_______________\n(1) (2) Included in selling, general and administrative expenses and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nIncluded in interest expense and merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows — operating leases $ 274 $ 287 $ 277\nOperating cash flows — finance leases 58 54 45\nFinancing cash flows — finance leases 136 291 176\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 125 202 Finance lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases 200 100 231\n794\nAs of September 1, 2024, future minimum payments during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n_______________\n(1) (2) Operating lease payments have not been reduced by expected future sublease income of $98.\nExcludes $1,080 of lease payments for leases that have been signed but not commenced.\nNote 6—Equity\nDividends\n(1)\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\n2025 $ 242 $ 204\n2026 247 128\n2027 226 120\n2028 209 122\n2029 183 109\nThereafter 2,205 1,664\nTotal (2)\n3,312 2,347\nLess amount representing interest 758 849\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,554 $ 1,498Note 4—Debt\nShort-Term Borrowings\nThe Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites.

Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",

Compensation\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the\nremaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate\nof 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs\nare generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was\nincreased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of\n1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to\nthe ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by\napproximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not\nchange. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,\nwhich resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special\ndividend, were outstanding:\n• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of\nperformance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the\nunits vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for\naccelerated vesting requirements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes RSU transactions during 2024:\nNumber of\nWeighted-Average\nUnits\nGrant Date Fair\n(in 000’s)\nValue\nOutstanding at the end of 2023 3,045 $ 405.63\nGranted 1,677 547.26\nVested and delivered (1,895) 432.40\nForfeited (80) 457.54\nSpecial cash dividend 52 N/A\nOutstanding at the end of 2024 2,799 $ 463.24\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $547.26, $471.47, and $476.06 in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The remaining\nunrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at the end of 2024 was $848 and the weighted-average period of time over which\nthis cost will be recognized is 1.6 years.

Short-term\nborrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at\nany time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal\namount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain\nevents, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all\noutstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In\nNovember 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates\nranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In\nJuly 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash\nequivalents and short-term investments.\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and\n$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)\n2024 2023\n$ —\n$ 1,000\n1,000 1,000\n1,250 1,250\n1,750 1,750\n1,000 1,000\n919 484\n5,919 6,484\nLess unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs 22 26\n103 1,081\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 5,794 $ 5,377\n_____________\n(1) Net of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMaturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\n2025 $ 103\n2026 76\n2027 2,250\n2028 —\n2029 150\nThereafter 3,340\nTotal $ 5,919Costco Stock Price: $940Beta: 0.79Cost of Debt: 6%10Y Treasury: 4.617%Assume Market Return is 11%Membership:\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;\nBusiness memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.\nBusiness members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star\nmembers. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships\ninclude a free household card.\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive\nmemberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive\nmembers earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.\nThe sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within\nsix months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures\nrenewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as\nmemberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\nGold Star Business, including affiliates Total paid members 1\nHousehold cards 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\n12,500 12,200 11,800\n76,200 71,000 65,800\n60,600 56,900 53,100\nTotal cardholders 136,800 127,900 118,900\n_______________\n(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65\nper year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the\nmaximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company\nreviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This\nevaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less\nthan carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income\napproach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies\nand transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable\nsegment:\nUnited States Canada Other International Total\nBalance at August 28, 2022 $ 953 $ 27 $ 13 $ 993\nChanges in currency translation —\n(1) 2 1\nBalance at September 3, 2023 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nChanges in currency translation —\n—\n—\n—\nBalance at September 1, 2024 $ 953 $ 26 $ 15 $ 994\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are\namortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.Note 8—Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is comprised of the following:\n2024 2023 2022\nDomestic Total $ 7,255 $ 6,264 $ 5,759\nForeign 2,485 2,223 2,081\n$ 9,740 $ 8,487 $ 7,840\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe provisions for income taxes are as follows:\nFederal:\nCurrent $ Deferred Total federal State:\nCurrent Deferred Total state Foreign:\nCurrent Deferred Total foreign Total provision for income taxes $ 2,373 $ 2,195 $ 1,925\n2024 2023 2022\n1,245 $ 1,056 $ 798\n48 33 (35)\n1,293 1,089 763\n431 374 333\n(77) 10 (5)\n354 384 328\n798 732 851\n(72) (10) (17)\n726 722 834\nThe reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal taxes at statutory rate $ 2,045 21.0 % $ 1,782 21.0 % $ 1,646 21.0 %\nState taxes, net Foreign taxes, net Other Total 288 3.0 302 3.6 267 3.4\n109 1.1 160 1.9 231 3.0\nEmployee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (120) (1.2) (25) (0.3) (23) (0.3)\n51 0.5 (24) (0.3) (196) (2.5)\n$ 2,373 24.4 % $ 2,195 25.9 % $ 1,925 24.6 %\nThe Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the\nCompany's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and\n$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.

The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested\nafter 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign\nwithholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The\nCompany considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and\nhas not provided for withholding or state taxes.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16\nGross increases—current year tax positions 3 1\nGross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11\nGross decreases—tax positions in prior years —\n(11)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (1)\nGross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year $ 81 $ 16\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the\ntiming of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,\nother than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the\npayment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective\nincome tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and\npenalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12\nmonths, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to\nestimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection\nwith the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The\nCompany is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various\njurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses\nassociated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain\nmatters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an\nindividual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land\nand Building                \nLease Land\nand/or\nBuilding(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico        499                         115                         614         \nCanada        91                         17                         108         \nOther International        113                         55                         168         \nTotal        703                         187                         890         \n \n_______________\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,\nMexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely\nbased on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which\nconsiders geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and\nexpenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.\nThe following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:\nUnited States Canada\nOther\nInternational Total\n2024\nTotal revenue $ 184,143 $ 34,874 $ 35,436 $ 254,453\nOperating income 6,217 1,648 1,420 9,285\nDepreciation and amortization 1,730 192 315 2,237\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,725 351 634 4,710\nProperty and equipment, net 20,638 2,602 5,792 29,032\nTotal assets 48,816 6,915 14,100 69,831\n2023\nTotal revenue $ 176,630 $ 33,056 $ 32,604 $ 242,290\nOperating income 5,392 1,448 1,274 8,114\nDepreciation and amortization 1,599 183 295 2,077\nAdditions to property and equipment 3,288 281 754 4,323\nProperty and equipment, net 18,760 2,443 5,481 26,684\nTotal assets 49,189 6,420 13,385 68,994\n2022\nTotal revenue $ 165,294 $ 31,675 $ 29,985 $ 226,954\nOperating income 5,268 1,346 1,179 7,793\nDepreciation and amortization 1,436 180 284 1,900\nAdditions to property and equipment 2,795 388 708 3,891\nProperty and equipment, net 17,205 2,459 4,982 24,646\nTotal assets 44,904 6,558 12,704 64,166RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2024 2023 2022\n$ 249,625 $ 237,710 $ 222,730\nNet Sales Changes in net sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 7 % 17 %\n6 % 4 % 16 %\nOther International 9 % 9 % 10 %\n5 % 7 % 16 %\n(1)\nChanges in comparable sales :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4 % 3 % 16 %\n7 % 2 % 15 %\nOther International 8 % 3 % 7 %\n5 % 3 % 14 %\n16 % (6)% 10 %\nE-commerce Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-\n(1)\ncurrency and gasoline prices :\nU.S. Canada Total Company 5 % 4 % 10 %\n8 % 8 % 12 %\nOther International 8 % 8 % 10 %\n6 % 5 % 11 %\n16 % (5)% 10 %\nE-commerce _______________\n(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core\nmerchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by\npharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes\nthe impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to\n2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales\nby approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight\ndecrease in average ticket.",
