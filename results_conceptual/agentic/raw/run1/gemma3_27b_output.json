    "question": "Suppose a company raises 25 million of debt and uses it to buy back shares from its shareholders. How does this transaction affect the firm's equity value (increase, decrease, or no change)?",
    "question_type": "conceptual",
    "answer": "Decrease",
    "response": "The transaction will decrease the firm's equity value. Here's why:\n\nWhen a company uses debt to buy back shares, it is increasing its financial leverage. While the number of outstanding shares decreases (which mechanically increases earnings per share), the increased debt introduces financial risk. The equity value represents the residual claim on the firm's assets after all debt holders are paid. Since the firm has taken on more debt, the equity holders have a smaller claim on the firm's assets, thus reducing the total equity value. \n\nMore formally, consider a simplified balance sheet before the transaction:\n\nAssets = Liabilities + Equity\n\nAfter the share repurchase financed by debt:\n\nAssets (unchanged) = Liabilities (increased) + Equity (decreased)\n\nThe increase in liabilities must be offset by a decrease in equity. While the repurchase can boost earnings per share, it doesn't change the overall value of the firm. It simply redistributes value from equity holders to debt holders, as debt holders now have a larger claim on the firm's assets.",

    "question": "You purchase a company for 150M at a 15x EBITDA multiple, hold it for 5 years without EBITDA growth, then exit at a 15x multiple. The investment is bought at 50% LTV with 4% cost of debt. You also spend 2M on capital expenditures annually. What are the MOIC and IRR of the deal? Assume add debt is paid down at exit and you only have access to a basic calculator.",

    "answer": "MOIC: 1.33x, IRR: 6%",
    "response": "The provided tools and simplified model are insufficient to calculate an accurate IRR. The results consistently show a MOIC of 0.50 and an IRR of 0.50, which are likely incorrect due to the lack of a proper debt amortization schedule and simplified cash flow calculations.

    "response": "If Company B funds an acquisition with debt, the resulting interest expenses will reduce its net earnings, while the added income from the acquired company will increase them. The net effect on net earnings depends on whether the incremental income exceeds the interest expense.\n\nIn the example calculation, with initial net earnings of $1,000,000, an acquisition price of $500,000 financed with debt at a 5% interest rate (resulting in $25,000 in interest expense), and an incremental income of $80,000 from the acquisition, the new net earnings would be $1,055,000 ($1,000,000 + $80,000 - $25,000).\n\nThe return on equity (ROE) is calculated as net earnings divided by shareholder equity. If we assume initial shareholder equity of $100, the new ROE would be 1055000%. This is an extremely high ROE, and highlights how debt financing can amplify returns on equity (but also increases financial risk).\n\nIt's important to note that this is a simplified example. A more comprehensive analysis would consider factors such as tax implications, synergies, and the cost of equity. Also, a very high ROE can be unsustainable and indicate excessive leverage.",

Firm A’s net income will be lower than Firm B’s because of the interest expense. However, the deductibility of interest creates a tax shield, partially offsetting this impact.

    "question": "Walk me through how the 3 statements are impacted by a merger.",
    "question_type": "conceptual",
    "answer": "For the income statement, the individual line items are combined. New line items are added for revenue or cost synergies as well as interest expense if debt was used to fund the acquisition or a change in interest expense from refinancing. Deal costs are also included. In the cash flow statement, you would also combine the line items, making to potentially factor new depreciation and amortization from changing values of intangible or tangible assets from the acquisition. If there are any principal payments related to the new debt, make sure to include that. Finally, combine balance sheet line items and make sure to add goodwill as an asset if the acquirer paid a premium to market value.",
    "response": "Here's how the three main financial statements – the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement – are impacted by a merger:\n\n**Income Statement:** The income statement reflects the combined revenue and expenses of the merging entities. You'll see a consolidation of both companies' top and bottom lines. Importantly, potential synergies achieved through the merger can lead to cost reductions and increased net income.\n\n**Balance Sheet:** The balance sheet will show consolidated assets and liabilities. A key item to watch is goodwill. This represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired.\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:** The cash flow statement will reflect the combined operating cash flows of the merged entity. In the investing activities section, you’ll see cash outflows related to the acquisition itself (the cash paid for the acquired company).

    "question": "A firm borrowed $300 in order to buy goods. It later sold those goods for $600, incurred $150 in operating expenses, paid 6% interest on the loan, and repaid 12% of the original principal. Assume a tax rate of 10% How are the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement affected after this transaction?",
    "question_type": "conceptual",
    "answer": "In the income statement, revenue is up 600, subtract 300 for COGS, 150 for Opex, so EBIT is 600 -300 -150 = 150. Interest expense is 300 * .12 = 36. Pre-tax income is 150 - 36 = 114. Post-tax income is 114 * 0.9 or 102.6. On the cash flow statement net income is up 102.6 and you add back 300 since inventory went down (and was a non-cash expense), 12% of principal is paid back or .12 * 300 = 36, so cash is up by 102.6 + 300 - 36 = 366.6. On the balance sheet, cash is up by 366.6, inventory is down by 300. On the liabilities side, debt is down by 36 and retained earnings is up by 102.6. 366.6 - 300 = 66.6.

    "question": "Company X buys back stock with debt. How does that impact the P/E ratio of the company?",

    "answer": "P/E ratio typically decreases",
    "response": "A company buying back stock with debt generally decreases the P/E ratio, all else being equal. Here's why, based on the calculations:\n\n*   **Reduced Share Count:** The buyback reduces the number of outstanding shares.\n*   **Lower Earnings:** The debt incurred to finance the buyback creates interest expense, which reduces the company's net earnings.\n*   **EPS Increase:** While earnings decrease overall, earnings per share (EPS) increases because there are fewer shares outstanding.\n*   **P/E Ratio Impact:** The initial calculation shows a P/E ratio of 1.0. The new P/E ratio is also 1.0. This is because the EPS increased by the same amount that the earnings decreased. The P/E ratio would only decrease if the EPS increased by a larger margin than the decrease in earnings.\n\nIn this specific example, the P/E ratio remained the same. However, in many cases, the increase in EPS will not offset the decrease in earnings, leading to a lower P/E ratio.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a simplified analysis.
